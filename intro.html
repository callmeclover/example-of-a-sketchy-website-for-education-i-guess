<h2>Intro to the web, and its dark side.</h2>
<p>Ah, the <b>internet</b>. A place filled with fun, games, movies, TV shows, and social hangouts. But what about the people who will do anything possible to get money?</p>
<p>To be mean to people on the internet for them to give them something they want? Or people who make dangerous computer <b>viruses</b> to infect thousands of computers with evil code?</p>
<p>These people are known as <b>scammers, cyberbullies, and hackers.</b> Now, we will focus mainly on one group now, but there will be definitions at the end of this text.</p>
<p>Now, onto scammers. These people will act like other people (or companies) to make profit. These people often target the elderly, or young children, because they dont know about scams much.</p>
<p>Be wary when talking with strangers. Not all are bad, some are really kind, but others will make you give them money. Now look at some examples, talk with your peers, and then see whats wrong with the web page.</p>
<p><b>Scammer:</b> a person who commits fraud or participates in a dishonest scheme.</p>
  <p><b>Cyberbullying:</b> the use of electronic communication to bully a person, typically by sending messages of an intimidating or threatening nature.</p>
  <p><b>Hacker:</b> a person who uses computers to gain unauthorized access to data.</p>
